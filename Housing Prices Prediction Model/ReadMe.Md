# üè° **Housing Price Prediction Model**

## üìñ Project Overview

This project aims to build a **machine learning model** that predicts **house prices** based on various property features. By leveraging a dataset of house attributes, the model provides insights that can assist stakeholders in the housing market with pricing decisions.

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various attributes of houses, including:

* **Lot Area**: Size of the lot in square feet.
* **Overall Quality**: Rating of the overall material and finish quality (1-10 scale).
* **Year Built**: Year when the house was constructed.
* **Total Basement Area**: Total square footage of the basement.
* **1st Floor Area**: Square footage of the first floor.
* **2nd Floor Area**: Square footage of the second floor.
* **Full Bathrooms**: Number of full bathrooms.
* **Garage Cars**: Garage size in terms of car capacity.
* **Sale Price**: Final selling price of the house (target variable).

**Data Source**: The dataset is located in the `housing_data.csv` file within this repository.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Libraries Used

To develop this model, the following Python libraries were utilized:

* **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **numpy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
* **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation metrics.
* **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
* **joblib**: For saving and loading the trained model.

## üîß Approach

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

* **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data was either imputed or dropped based on feature significance.
* **Feature Encoding**: Categorical variables were encoded for model compatibility.
* **Feature Scaling**: Standardization of numerical features for better model performance.

### 2. **Model Development**

* **Training & Testing Split**: The dataset was divided into **80% training** and **20% testing** for model evaluation.
* **Model Choice**: A **Linear Regression** model was selected to predict the target variable (**Sale Price**).

### 3. **Model Evaluation**

* **Metrics**:

  * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 24,000
  * **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 1,100,000,000
  * **R-squared Score**: 0.85

---

## üìà Results and Insights

* **R-squared Score**: The model explains **85% of the variance** in house prices, indicating a strong fit.
* **MAE**: On average, the predictions are off by **\$24,000**, which is reasonable for price prediction.
* **MSE**: There's some variance in the predictions, suggesting opportunities for improving the model, possibly by adding more features or exploring more complex algorithms.

## üèÅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of **machine learning** in regression tasks. The linear regression model achieves a strong prediction accuracy with an **R-squared score of 0.85**. Although the model performs well, future improvements could involve exploring more advanced algorithms or additional features to enhance accuracy.
